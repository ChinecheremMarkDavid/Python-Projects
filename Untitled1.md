Title: Employee Performance Improvement Analysis

Description:

The project aimed to analyze employee performance and the impact of training interventions on performance improvement.
It involved processing two CSV files containing employee data and training outcomes, merging them, and conducting an
analysis to identify the number of employees needing improvement and those whose performance improved due to training.


Insights:

● Performance Score Distribution: The analysis revealed the distribution of employees across different performance scores,
with a focus on those needing improvement.

● Effectiveness of Training: By comparing employee performance before and after training, the project assessed the
effectiveness of training interventions in improving employee performance.

● Identification of Improvement Areas: The project identified areas where employees require additional support or
training to enhance their performance.

● Quantitative Assessment: Through quantitative analysis, the project provided concrete numbers regarding the impact
of training on performance improvement.


Recommendations:

● Targeted Training Programs: Develop targeted training programs to address specific performance improvement areas
identified through the analysis.

● Continuous Evaluation: Implement a system for continuous evaluation of employee performance to track progress over time
and identify emerging improvement needs.

● Feedback Mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather insights from employees regarding the effectiveness of
training programs and areas for improvement.

● Individual Development Plans: Create individual development plans for employees based on their performance assessment to tailor training interventions to their specific needs.

● Monitor Long-Term Impact: Continuously monitor the long-term impact of training interventions on employee performance to assess the sustainability of improvements and adjust strategies as needed.

● Collaboration Between HR and Operations: Foster collaboration between HR and operational departments to ensure alignment between training initiatives and organizational goals

# Function to read and process CSV files
def process_csv(file_path, columns, sort_by):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)[columns]
    return df.sort_values(by=sort_by, ascending=True)

# Read and process the first CSV file
employee_data = process_csv('employee_data.csv', ['EmpID', 'Performance Score', 'Current Employee Rating'], 'EmpID')


# Read and process the second CSV file
training_data = process_csv('training_and_development_data.csv', ['Employee ID', 'Training Outcome'], 'Employee ID')

training_data.columns = ['EmpID', 'Training Outcome']


# Merge the DataFrames on 'EmpID' and reset the index
join = pd.merge(employee_data, training_data, on='EmpID').reset_index(drop=True)

# Print the resulting DataFrame
print(join.to_string())

# Custom code to count the number of employees needing improvement and 
# the number of employees whose performance improved due to training
needs_improvement = join[join['Performance Score'] == 'Needs Improvement']
improved = needs_improvement[needs_improvement['Current Employee Rating'] >= 3]

# Print the number of staff needing improvement and staff with improved performance
print("Number of staff needing improvement:", len(needs_improvement))
print("Staff with improved performance:", len(improved))

# Calculate the number of employees who failed to improve
failed_to_improve = len(needs_improvement) - len(improved)

# Create a NumPy array with the counts of employees who failed to improve and those who improved
ax = np.array([failed_to_improve, len(improved)])

# Create labels for the categories
mylabels = ["Failed to Improve", "Improved"]

# Plot a bar chart
plt.bar(mylabels, ax)
plt.show()

# summary of the code
# first I created a function process_csv to read and process CSV files.
# The function takes the file path, columns to select, and the column to sort by.
# It reads the CSV file, selects the specified columns, and sorts the DataFrame by the specified column. 

# i applied the process_csv function to read and process the first CSV file (employee_data.csv) and the second CSV file (training_and_development_data.csv).
# then i Renamed the 'Employee ID' column to 'EmpID' in the second CSV file to maintain consistency.

# i Merged the two DataFrames based on the 'EmpID' column using pd.merge.
# And Printed the resulting DataFrame after merging.
# Reset the index to create a cleaner DataFrame.

# Used DataFrame operations to filter employees needing improvement and those whose performance improved.
# Calculated the number of employees who failed to improve.

# Printed the number of staff needing improvement and staff with improved performance.

# Created a NumPy array with the counts of employees who failed to improve and those who improved.
# Last but not the least Plotted a bar chart using Matplotlib.

# Conclusion:
# The project provided valuable insights into employee performance improvement and the effectiveness of training interventions.
# By leveraging data-driven analysis, organizations can make informed decisions to optimize their training programs and support employees in
# achieving their full potential.
